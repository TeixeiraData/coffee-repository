## coffee analysis!!!

REMEMBER
When selecting subsets of data, square brackets [] are used.

Inside these brackets, you can use a single column/row label, a list of column/row labels, a slice of labels, a conditional expression or a colon.

Select specific rows and/or columns using loc when using the row and column names

Select specific rows and/or columns using iloc when using the positions in the table

You can assign new values to a selection based on loc/iloc.

REMEMBER
Create a new column by assigning the output to the DataFrame with a new column name in between the [].

Operations are element-wise, no need to loop over rows.

Use rename with a dictionary or function to rename row labels or column names.
